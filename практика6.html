    <h2> What is HTML? </h2>
    <p>
       <b> Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) </b> the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
    </p>
    <p>Web browsers receive HIML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages, HTML, describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document
    </p>
    <p>HTML, elements are the building blocks of HTML, pages. Wah HTML, constructs, images and other oljects
such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantes lor text such as hinadings, paragraphs, lests, anka quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by toys, written using angle br√§ckets. Tags such as <span class="m1"> &lt;/img&gt; </span> and <span class="m1"> &lt;inout/&gt; </span> introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <span class="m1">&lt;p&gt;</span> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not
display the HTML, tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page. </p>

    <h1> Markup </h1>
    <p>HTML, markup comists of several key components, including those called toys (and their attributes), character-based dota types, character references and entity references. HIML tags most commonly come in pais like <span class="m1"> &lt;h1&gt; </span> and <span class="m1"> &lt;/h1&gt; </span>, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <span class="m1"> &lt;img&gt; </span>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tog, and the second is the end tog (they are also called opening toys and closing togs)</p>
    <p> Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering </p>
    <p> The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program: </p>
    <pre>
        <span class="v1">     &lt;!DOCTYPE html> </span>
        <span class="v1">     &lt;html> 
        <span class="v1">         &lt;head> </span>
        <span class="v1">             &lt;title> </span> <span class="v2"> Document </span> <span class="v1"> &lt;/title> </span>
        <span class="v1">        &lt;/head> </span>
        <span class="v1">        &lt;body> </span>
        <span class="v1">            &lt;p> </span> <span class="v2">  Hello, world </span> <span class="v1"> &lt;/p> </span>
        <span class="v1">       &lt;/body> </span>
        <span class="v1">      &lt;/html> </span>
